# 🧠 Manashakti Wisdom-On-Demand

Manashakti Search is an advanced AI-powered knowledge retrieval system designed to make a vast library of philosophical and psychological wisdom easily discoverable. Built for the "AI for Good" Hackathon, it transforms static documents into a conversational "Knowledge Tank."

## 🌊 Key Features
- **Ocean to Glass Precision**: Unlike standard AI, this system uses a custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to filter an "ocean" of raw data into a precise "glass" of fact-based answers, eliminating hallucinations.
- **Multilingual Semantic Intelligence**: Native support for Marathi, Hindi, and English.
- **Contextual & Emotional Search**: Understands user "moods" and life situations beyond basic keywords.
- **Strictly Grounded Guardrails**: If information is missing, the system safely responds with "Content not found" rather than guessing.

## 🏗️ The Architecture
The system follows a structured flow from raw data to referenced output:
1. **Knowledge Ingestion**: Raw books and scanned images are processed via Google Document AI.
2. **Semantic Indexing**: Text is chunked by logic and converted into numerical vectors using SBERT.
3. **The Knowledge Tank**: Vectors are stored in ChromaDB with metadata for precise retrieval.
4. **Semantic Retrieval**: A filter detects the language and performs a high-speed similarity search.
5. **Grounded Generation**: The LLM (GPT-4) formats the answer only from the provided data.

## 🛠️ Technical Tech Stack
### Frontend & Backend
- **React & Tailwind CSS**: Modern, responsive user interface.
- **Node.js**: Core runtime for application logic.

### AI/ML Pipeline
- **Google Document AI**: High-accuracy OCR for complex PDFs.
- **SBERT (Sentence-BERT)**: Multilingual vector representations.
- **ChromaDB**: Open-source vector database for embeddings and metadata.
- **GPT-4**: High-reasoning model with strict prompt engineering.

## 🧩 Problem Solved
Traditional search methods failed to navigate the rich but scattered content of Manashakti literature. By implementing this RAG pipeline, we:
- Solved the "upload limit" error of standard LLMs.
- Preserved philosophical nuances through Logic-based Chunking.
- Ensured that impact-heavy knowledge reaches the right audience at the right time.
